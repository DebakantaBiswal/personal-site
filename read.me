
Hey, I'm Debakanta Biswal, a Computer Science and Engineering grad with a passion for blending tech with creativity.
I'm all about UI/UX design, data analytics, and entrepreneurship â€“ turning ideas into reality is my jam.
Beyond tech, I'm into history and geopolitics, fascinated by how the past shapes our world today. Always curious, always exploring, that's me!
